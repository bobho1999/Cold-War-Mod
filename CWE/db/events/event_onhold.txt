EVT_103_DESC;When the fight begun on January 18, 1955, the nationalist air force and navy did not participate due to the overwhelming communist firepower. The battle started at 8:00AM with communist bombers from three groups and ground attack aircraft from 2 groups bombing and strafing the islands. At the same time, bombers from another group and ground attack aircraft from the second group bombed and strafing Dachen Islands as a diversion. At 9:00 AM, 50 long range artilleries shelled Yijiangshan Islands.Around noon, 70+ naval vessels carrying the landing force sailed from Gaodao (??)?Queerao (???)?Toumen Mountain Island (????) in three formations in two waves, with more than 40 escort vessels. 2 hours later, the 10 specially converted naval vessels with rocket launchers bombarded Yijiangshan island in conjunction with bombers from 3 groups and 1 squadron, ground attack aircraft from 2 groups, before landing on 20 landing spots. However, the defenders took advantage of their fortifications and severely disrupted the attackers’ formation after their successful landing. As a result, most of the communist casualties suffered during the battle were at this initial stage.The attackers immediately called for fire support after they met with fierce enemy fire, and the communist aircraft responded by attacking the enemy position with great accuracy by flying at the extremely low altitude, in fact, most of the aircraft in the air support mission flew below the trajectory of artilleries, and the psychological effect on the defenders was far more greater than the actual precision strikes, resulting in the total collapse of the morale. As the demoralized defenders retreated into their underground tunnels, the attackers adjusted their tactics by fighting in small groups, and by using recoilless guns and flame throwers to gradually neutralize the enemy’s positions, including the underground tunnel complex of the nationalist 4th Assault Group, the largest on the island.;;;;;;;;;X
