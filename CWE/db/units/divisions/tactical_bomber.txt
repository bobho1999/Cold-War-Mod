### Attack bombers designed to counter missile defense
### increased effectiveness against armor, ships and strategic targets
### designed for low approach below enemy radar
### no improvement in soft attack or air combat
### use escort fighter to get air defense bonus
### on later models cannons were phased out in favor of missiles
