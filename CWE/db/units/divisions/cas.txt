#### Jet propulsion not an advantage to early Cold War
#### CAS. Planes need to be slow and loiter long to
#### maximize kill. They remained prop planes for many
#### years ( turbojets phased in 1945-60 also turboprops)
#### HOI2 stats retained for CAS 3-5 with small
#### changes but model descriptions changed.
